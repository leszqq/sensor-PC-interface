# PC accelerometer
## _Wiktor Lechowicz_   

PC acceloremeter is a STM32 MCU based interface for operating accelerometer sensor via personal computer.
Key features are:
- Data accuracy and rate selection
- Free fall detection
- Click detecion

## User Interface
User interface is based on command line interface based on UART. There is an idea to create desktop application based on python to make interface more user firendly. 

## Tech
Application is based on the following hardware modules:
- STM32F302R8 microcontroller
- LSM303D System in package incorporating accelerometer, magnetometer and temperature sensor
